 ðŸ§  Pure JavaScript CPU Emulator

This is a fully functional CPU emulator built entirely in **vanilla JavaScript**â€”no frameworks, no libraries, no dependencies. It includes:

- A custom instruction set (LOAD, ADD, JMP)
- A simple assembler that parses human-readable code
- A visual debugger that shows execution step-by-step
- A simulated memory and register system
